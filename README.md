# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of increasingly complex problems that require both mathematical and programming expertise to solve: one needs to use mathematics to develop and prove the correctness of an algorithm, but the end result is often impossible to calculate by hand, so it will be necessary to write a computer program that arrives at the result "in less than one minute on a moderately powered computer".

They allow solutions to the first 100 problems to be posted publicly, so I'll be posting my solutions here as I create them.

I'm mostly coding them in **C** in order to teach myself the language, but I will employ **Python** when I get stuck on a problem.
